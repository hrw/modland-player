This is source of my Protracker modules player.

Features:
- modules are fetched from MODland archive using FTP
- separate UI for desktop
- separate UI for Maemo5
- selection of UI is done by platform (req Qt 4.6 on Maemo5)

Requirements:
- GStreamer modplug plugin - not present under Maemo5

Parts of code based on following Qt examples:
- Phonon Music Player
- Contacts Form
- Dialogs
- Maemo5 Widgets
- and few others which I forgot.
